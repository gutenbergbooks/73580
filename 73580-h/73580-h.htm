<p class="noi"><i>Andrew Undershaft.</i>—“Every blessed foundling
nowadays is snapped up in his infancy
by Barnado homes, or School Board Officers,
or Boards of Guardians; and if he shows the
least ability he is fastened on by schoolmasters;
trained to win scholarships like a racehorse;
crammed with second-hand ideas; drilled and
disciplined in docility and what they call good
taste; and lamed for life so that he is fit for
nothing but teaching.”—(<i>Bernard Shaw</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>During the Debate on the last
Education Estimates (1925), Lord
Hugh Cecil made a speech which
most enthusiasts of education dismissed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
offhand as hopelessly reactionary.
In the central part of his argument
he deprecated the doctrine that
education is to be equally distributed
to all sorts of people, irrespective of
their real capacity. He maintained
that we must train children for the
station to which, not by birth but by
natural capacity, they properly belong.
He would select the clever
children and spend money liberally
in giving them the fullest possible
opportunities for higher study. But
to the great body of children who are
incapable of really using any higher
teaching he would give a very low
standard of education confined to the
three R’s: the teaching of reading
should be made the basis, for reading
is the key to knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>These views are certainly extreme;
but, looked at impartially, they contain
so much plain common-sense
that it is rather remarkable that they
provoked such bitter opposition. Of
course, Lord Hugh Cecil laid himself
open to two obvious charges: first,
that he had no special knowledge of
his subject, and, secondly, that his
reforms were presumably intended
for the children of masses and not
those of his own class. But his opponents
must take account of the
statement made a few weeks later by
the headmaster of Rugby, whose
opinions cannot be discounted on
these two grounds. Speaking as
President of the Education Section
of the British Association, Dr
Vaughan disputed the assumption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
that the State should develop to the
full the intellectual abilities of all
its citizens. He considered that
schooling is even now continued too
long for some boys. He would give
a thrice-generous remission after
fourteen to those who had shewn no
special aptitude for book-learning or
any other form of direct education,
on condition that they were kept
within the spell of corporate life.
Thus a distinguished practical schoolmaster
corroborates the view of Lord
Hugh Cecil that before providing
unlimited educational facilities we
should face the fact that many children
are not amenable to the present
educational process; and we ought
therefore to consider whether we are
promoting either their efficiency as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
citizens or their happiness as individuals
by submitting them to a training
for which they are not fitted. We are
reminded that education has of recent
years become a cult whose followers
allow their zeal to blind them
to stubborn realities.</p>

<p>The suggestion that we are on a
false track in seeking to multiply indefinitely
the educational institutions
of existing type naturally provokes
strong opposition, for it runs counter
to one of the most cherished democratic
doctrines of to-day. Ever since
the first extension of the franchise,
publicists have been preaching that
the success of democracy depends
upon the diffusion of culture among
the masses who have the ultimate control
of affairs. And whenever fears<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
have been expressed that popular
government has fallen short of the
original ideal we have been assured
that all will be well as soon as the
electorate is properly educated. The
public has thus been taught to believe
that it is the duty of the State
(so long as the financial position
permits) to increase to the utmost
the facilities for training its citizens.</p>

<p>The need for more education has,
in fact, become a political commonplace.
It has been only too easy for
statesmen who have little real interest
in the matter to talk vaguely
about the educational ladder from the
elementary school to the university,
because such talk provides plausible
material for the platform-speaker
whose business it is to rehabilitate a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
popular system which has not quite
come up to expectations. In a somewhat
disillusioned democratic world
education has threatened to become a
political nostrum to be unintelligently
applied and to be foolishly regarded
as a panacea.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, the latest of a series
of expedients prompted by belief in
the perfectibility of mankind. A century
or so ago republican reformers
imagined that all the ills the State is
heir to would be cured if King
George’s government were replaced
by a government of Tom Paine’s.
Later on, the radicals thought that
the millennium would be reached
when every adult had a vote. The
present generation has been too readily
fooled by the equally delusive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
hope that the new Utopia will be
created when everybody receives a
university education at public expense.</p>

<p>It is therefore all to the good that
our leaders should occasionally remind
us that education is not a magic
weapon of unlimited power. It is
time that the public mind was disabused
of the notion that a perfect
system of education would of itself
prove the salvation of the State. The
fallacy lies, of course, in the assumption
that everybody is capable of being
educated. Those who are personally
in touch with schools see only too
clearly how unwarrantable such an
assumption is. While they realise
that every child, dull or clever, benefits
by being under discipline and by
taking part in the social life of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
school, they know also that a certain
proportion of children undergo no
mental development commensurate
with the time and labour expended on
their behalf. Thus even if we
imagine a perfect educational process,
carried out by teachers who are all
men and women of light and leading,
the result of that process will be ultimately
conditioned by the quality
of the human beings who pass through
it. Just as democracy pre-supposes
education, so education pre-supposes
children who are educable. It would
seem, therefore, that political and
social reformers who are still looking
for a panacea must go to the
eugenists.</p>

<p>The public statement of considered
views such as those of Lord Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Cecil and the Headmaster of Rugby
is one of the signs that we are at
length emerging from the mental attitude
which expresses itself in the
crude demand for more and more
education to be doled out indiscriminately.
It is indeed time that we got
rid of the prevalent notion that
schools are factories (chiefly brain-factories)
which can pass any sort of
human material through a standardised
course and in so many years turn
out satisfactory finished products.
And the friends of education need
not be alarmed at the new trend of
opinion. All reasonable people now
admit the theoretical principle that
the State must provide adequate training
for all future citizens; and the
Labour Party is flogging a dead horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
when it insists so laboriously that
every child, irrespective of social
status, should be given the fullest
educational opportunities. Present-day
informed discussion has advanced
beyond the consideration of this almost
platitudinous statement of principle
to an enquiry of a much more
important character. The question
being now asked is not whether every
child should be given education to
the age of sixteen or beyond, but what
kinds of education ought to be provided
for the many thousands of children
of varied types who will receive
advanced training through the increased
facilities to be provided in
the future.</p>

<p>The stage of educational development
upon which we are now entering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
will, in fact, be marked by greater
realism in the attitude of both the
authorities and the general public
towards the problems to be solved.
We are gradually coming to acknowledge
the fairly obvious truth that
not every child is a potential Prime
Minister, or even a capable civil servant,
or a manager of a business.
When we have shed the more romantic
of the democratic habits of thought
we shall even publicly admit that a
certain proportion of mankind
(whether the offspring of dukes or of
dustmen) are fitted by nature to be
nothing better than hewers of wood
and drawers of water, and that to
give them more than a limited amount
of ordinary schooling is to perform a
work of sentimental supererogation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
We shall also realise that the course
of instruction which has now become
stereotyped as secondary, however admirable
in itself, is a course for which
relatively few children are really
suited. And when we have taken
more account than at present of the
profound differences in individual
capacities we shall cease to think of an
education as something extraneous to
the person educated, and to regard the
school-curriculum as a Procrustean
bed, to suit the dimensions of which
the child’s mentality can be extended
or truncated as required.</p>

<small>THE SCHOOLS<br>

<span class="smcap">Present-Day Problems and Tendencies</span></small></h2>
</div>


<p>A survey of present tendencies
makes it clear that the next few years
will witness a general overhaul of the
educational machine. Among both
the general public and the teaching
profession the feeling is becoming
widespread that, quite apart from its
obvious incompleteness, our present
system suffers from certain fundamental
defects. Damaging criticisms
of the work of the schools are by no
means infrequent in press-articles.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
The proceedings of the various teachers’
organizations are eloquent of the
need for radical reforms. Business
men are giving public expression to
their concern about the inadequacy of
school-training for economic requirements:
the Association of British
Chambers of Commerce, for instance,
has recently passed a resolution containing
a sweeping condemnation of
the methods and aims of the elementary
schools. Already an official enquiry
is being conducted into the relationship
between the schools and
industry. These signs of an impending
revision of our educational programme
derive added importance
from the consideration that for some
years to come Chancellors of the
Exchequer will be very unwilling to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
sanction increases in public expenditure.
Education ministers will therefore
have to make out a very good
case for any new developments and
will have to satisfy public opinion
that they are not merely increasing
material and personnel but are also
promoting increased efficiency.</p>

<p>The inevitable enquiry into the
working of our present system will
necessarily concern itself mainly with
post-primary training since it is in
this direction that development is
most urgently needed. It is almost
universally admitted that the time is
overdue for a largely increased provision
of further education of children
beyond the age of fourteen; for
though the secondary schools, owing
to faulty methods of admission, at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
present contain many pupils who are
unfit for the training they receive,
there are also outside these schools
numbers of children who reach the
required standard of ability but who
are denied entry simply because there
is no room for them.</p>

<p>Public educational policy during
the last quarter of a century has provided
for higher education mainly by
the foundation of secondary schools
of a single type, controlled by the
local authorities; and those who demand
more secondary education generally
mean more schools of this kind.
The secondary schools are filled partly
by scholarship-holders who represent
the cream of the elementary schools,
and partly by fee-payers who, as they
do not usually have to pass a stringent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
entrance-examination, may represent
all grades of ability. Thus only
a proportion (now up to 40 per cent.)
of the pupils are specially selected;
the remainder are doing more advanced
work simply because their
parents wish it and can pay part of
the cost.</p>

<p>When the activities of these schools
come under a critical review, certain
facts will be difficult to explain away.
In the first place, it will be noticed
that, although the pupils are intended
to remain at school until the age of
sixteen at least, a relatively large proportion
leave before that age. According
to the “London Statistics”
for 1923–24, there were present at
the end of 1923 in the aided and
maintained secondary schools of London,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
9,118 pupils who were twelve
or thirteen years of age, 8,700 who
were fourteen or fifteen, 3,280 who
were sixteen or seventeen, and 342
who were eighteen or over. In other
words, only about one-third remained
until the age of sixteen or more, and
this in spite of the fact that parents
give undertakings to keep their children
at school until sixteen. Again,
the curriculum of these schools is
largely determined by the First
School Examination (equivalent to
University Matriculation), and every
pupil who remains at school sufficiently
long should normally take this
examination. Now the report of the
Board of Education for 1923–24
shows that in each of the last five
years an average of 78,000 children<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
have entered the grant-earning secondary
schools of England and the
highest number that has taken the
First School Examination in any one
year is roughly 35,000, of whom
about a third failed. That is to say,
about two-thirds of the pupils either
fail to complete the school course or
fail to reach the standard of intellectual
attainment necessary to pass an
external test.</p>

<p>When all allowance has been made
for the fact that a certain number of
pupils are withdrawn at an early age
purely on account of economic circumstances,
we have still to face the
failure of the schools to retain the
pupils and to enable them to pass
what is presumably a fair test of the
kind of training given. The conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
can scarcely be avoided that there
are some radical defects in the aims
and methods of the schools.</p>

<p>It is often urged that the secondary
schools are not at present getting the
best material, that owing to economic
circumstances or to the insufficient
provision of secondary school accommodation
many children who are fit
to profit by higher instruction are at
present excluded in favour of fee-payers
who are not fit. But this is
merely begging the question. We are
still confronted with the problem of
what we are to do with those pupils
who do not take kindly to the secondary
school curriculum but who, by
their very presence in secondary
schools, show their readiness to undergo
some form of higher instruction.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
And what are we to do with the many
children in the primary schools who,
under a scheme of more extended
financial assistance, might also remain
at school until sixteen or later, and
would also be square pegs in round
holes in the ordinary secondary
school?</p>

<p>We are forced, therefore, to ask
whether the present secondary school
curriculum is adapted to the needs of
the varied types of pupils who enter
or are likely to enter the schools.
What are the aims? At present the
secondary school’s main function is to
give sufficient training in the humanities,
in mathematics and science, to
enable pupils to pass the entrance
examination of a university. (We
may for the purpose of the present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
argument disregard the social activities
of the school.) In other words,
its business is to produce scholars of
the intellectual type fitted for university
training. It is true that art,
handicraft, domestic science, and
physical exercises appear in the curriculum
but they occupy more or less
subordinate places. The secondary
school course, on its academic side, is
directed to one main end, and any
pupil who enters such a school is regarded,
irrespective of his natural aptitudes,
as a prospective candidate for
matriculation. Teachers may demur
to the suggestion that their horizon is
dominated by an examination: they
may talk hopefully about a test which
their pupils can take “in their stride.”
But the fact remains that the work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of the upper part of the school is
determined by requirements of an external
body. There is a conventional
list of “subjects” which the pupil
must study, and if his individuality
does not fit in with this scheme so
much the worse for him.</p>

<p>The secondary schools are therefore
designed, in so far as they are designed
for any specific purpose, as a
training-ground for university students.
But only three per cent. of
the pupils ever reach the universities.
And the statistics already given indicate
that a large proportion show
themselves to be unfitted for university
training. Teachers in secondary
schools do not, of course, need these
statistics to bring home to them the
fact that a considerable proportion of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
the pupils with whom they have to
deal are misfits. They realise that
there are other sorts of capacity besides
those which enable pupils to pass
the usual examinations. They constantly
see in their pupils special interests
and aptitudes which find little
or no outlet in the ordinary academic
routine. They so often have to shake
hands with old boys or old girls who
were duffers at ordinary school subjects,
but who have since achieved
success in business or industry that it
has become a commonplace with them
that failure at school does not necessarily
mean failure in life. But this
commonplace surely implies the tragic
fact that school has not discovered
what the “duffer” can do, but has
consistently tried to make him do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
things for which he has no aptitude.</p>

<p>The fact is that the ordinary secondary
school is attempting—unsuccessfully,
of course—to give the same
treatment to pupils of various types
who, owing to lack of sufficiently
varied provision for higher education,
now find themselves herded together.
In any such school there is a certain
number of pupils of good general
ability who are capable of proceeding
with credit to advanced work in the
humanities or in science. These are
the pupils for whom the secondary
course is really intended. At the other
extreme there is a certain number
who are simply not profiting by academic
training. Between these extremes
there are, no doubt, a few
who have a natural bent towards one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
of the arts; there are a good many
of very pedestrian abilities who can
by industry just keep abreast of their
studies, though they are not attracted
by academic ideals; and there are
still others who are in difficulties
because they are interested not in
abstract ideas but in things. Pupils
of these three classes are all, to a
greater or less degree, misfits in the
ordinary secondary school. The few
intending to follow the arts and lacking
wide intellectual interests should
be devoting more time than is generally
available to acquiring the technique
of their art. The many of a
little less than average capacity who
have no real enthusiasm for things of
the mind gain something, no doubt,
from the course they pursue, but they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
would gain more from a practical curriculum
containing fewer subjects and
having a more direct bearing on their
probable future careers. The remaining
class, which includes those who
think with their hands, is the one for
which we now most conspicuously fail
to make adequate provision. In this
category is to be found the boy who is
bored by the theory of electricity
while being thoroughly interested in
making a piece of electrical apparatus,
and who will not willingly learn any
more of the theory than is necessary
to make the apparatus work. When
we consider that a large proportion of
people in the world have no bookish
interests and are not attracted by pure
science and yet are capable of bringing
sound intelligence to bear on practical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
problems concerning concrete things,
it is strange that educationists have
done so little to meet their needs.</p>

<p>Another question arises. What is
to be the occupation of the pupils
leaving the secondary schools? Those
who have remained at these schools
until sixteen or more acquire a certain
social tone which causes them to
despise manual toil, and so they aim
at the professions, the Civil Service,
posts in banks and stores, and, failing
all else, the perennially respectable
junior clerkship in any kind of office.
Clearly, boys who have at seventeen
or eighteen successfully completed a
course of literary and scientific training
should be fitted for posts of responsibility
in business or the professions.
But the professions are already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
overcrowded, and positions are difficult
to obtain. We are taking children
from the homes of artisans,
small tradespeople, and even unskilled
workers, and giving them an
education which makes them unwilling
to take up the same occupation
as their parents follow, but which
leads to no certainty of better employment
in the end. We are thus rapidly
being brought face to face with the
difficulty which confronted Germany
before the War. The advantages
attaching to scholastic attainment were
such that every parent who could
possibly do so gave his child a higher
education so that he might obtain the
coveted passport to the professions.
The result was that the competition
for the higher professional and official<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
posts became intolerably keen, and the
universities were turning out numbers
of fully qualified men for whom they
could find no suitable employment.</p>

<p>There would be less theoretical objection
to the process of raising the
pupils out of the economic class of
their families into another class, if
they were all of high capacity and
suitable for administrative posts. But,
actually, many of those who at present
receive higher education are by no
means fitted by native ability for important
administrative work. In fact,
the investigations of the psychologists
go to show that out of the whole child
population only a small proportion
have the grade of intelligence needed
for the highest posts. Dr Cyril Burt
has carried out a survey of London<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
school children, by means of intelligence-tests,
to provide evidence for
use in vocational guidance. He finds
that the few children of the type who
win scholarships to secondary schools
and thence to the universities, and
who are fitted to seek higher professional
and Civil Service posts form
about one per thousand of the child
population. About two per cent. come
into the second grade, which includes
those who win scholarships to the
secondary school but not to the university,
and who are suitable for lower
professional posts: they may become,
for instance, elementary teachers,
clerks holding responsible posts, or
successful tradespeople. The third
grade is composed of about ten per<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
cent. of the children, and includes
those who are suited to become, say,
clerks doing work of an intelligent
but moderately routine character, or
manual workers engaged in highly
skilled work. Below this comes a body
of children of moderate ability forming
about four-fifths of the whole.
These may enter many of the ordinary
commercial posts,—they may become
small tradespeople, or shop-assistants:
skilled manual-workers also
belong to this group. The remaining
children have an intelligence which
fits them only for unskilled work.
This classification is, admittedly, only
tentative; but if it has any validity, it
is clear that the percentage of children
really fitted for professional work is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
relatively very low, and account must
be taken of this fact in framing secondary
courses.</p>

<p>Realising the difficulty of finding
suitable employment for their pupils,
and sensitive about the accusation
that they aim at producing “black-coated
workers” only, the Headmasters
have considered the possibility
of finding openings in industry. In
1924 the Council of the Headmasters’
Association sent a deputation to the
Federation of British Industries on
the matter. The deputation was told
quite plainly that manufacturers, and
particularly engineers, made a regular
practice of taking boys at fourteen:
they had very little opportunity to
offer to the boy who remained at
school long enough to take the First<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
School Examination, and still less to
the boy who passed a Higher School
Examination. There is little prospect
that manufacturers will be able to
alter their practice in this respect.
Obviously, therefore, with our present
lack of co-ordination between our
educational and industrial systems, a
boy deprives himself of many chances
of employment by staying at school
beyond fourteen.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that this
particular aspect of the educational
problem will attract much official
attention in the near future. There
is even a chance that the issue may
not be unduly obscured by political
controversy, for leading politicians of
both sides agree in their diagnosis.
The President of the Board of Education,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Lord Eustace Percy, has recently
told a meeting that the desire of the
working man to-day is to use the
school to get his son into some black-coated
job and to keep him away from
skilled manual labour. This he regarded
as a most extraordinary mistake.
We should never get any real
success until we re-created the pride
of skilled manual work. In another
speech he said that the danger of the
secondary school system was that,
when we should be using these schools
for training leaders for all the professions
and industries and businesses,
we are in fact using them to train the
subordinates in a few “respectable”
industries. Such remarks might pass
with many people for an expression of
reactionary Toryism, if their attention<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
were not called to the fact that Mr.
Philip Snowden has recently written
to the same effect in a Sunday newspaper—“A
scholastic education is apt
to make a youth despise useful mechanical
work. The products of our
secondary schools and universities are
crowding the black-coated professions
and occupations. Education is a failure
unless it inculcates the idea that
all useful work is honourable, and
that the working engineer, or carpenter,
or weaver is a more useful
member of society than a ‘commission
agent’. Society needs men and women
with the highest scholastic attainments.
But the number of such will
always be small. The main part of
the education problem is to fit the
average person for the work of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
average person.” The practical urgency
of these views is indicated by
the fact that the President of the
Board of Education and the Minister
of Labour have now jointly appointed
a committee to inquire into the public
system of education in relation to the
requirements of trade and industry.</p>

<p>Idealists of a certain sort, however,
will brush aside the sordid controversy
about commercial values and will put
up a hard fight for the principle of a
Liberal Education,—an All-round
Training that will provide an Outfit
for Life. They will continue to
maintain that the traditional modicum
of the classics, mathematics, science,
and the modern tongues, provides the
best training for a lad, whether he is
to become a clerk, an engineer, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
company-promoter, or a pork-butcher.
They will recoil in horror from the
mere mention of “vocational training.”</p>

<p>But this “liberal education” theory
involves several fallacies,—fallacies
which are now being perceived in
many quarters, and which will be
completely exposed in the next few
years. In the first place, an education
completely divorced from the requirements
of a vocation is a luxury
appropriate only to a leisured class,
or a class free from economic pressure:
it is, in fact, a legacy from
the independent families of the upper
classes or the well-to-do middle classes
who sent their children to the public
schools and the old grammar schools,
knowing that the question of bread
and butter was not an urgent one.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
Now, in the changed conditions of the
twentieth century, we still complacently
take boys from working-class
homes, give them a “liberal” education
until they are sixteen or eighteen,
and then turn many of them adrift to
become clerks or grocers’ assistants,
laying the flattering unction to our
soul, as we say farewell, that they will
add their figures or cut their rashers
all the better for having tasted the
sweets of poetry or wrestled with the
problems of geometry. Of course,
some of the boys concerned may find
their true niche in clerking or in the
grocery line; in which case their intellectual
ability is such that training
in the more abstruse mathematical or
linguistic processes has been wasted on
them. But if we give a boy of ability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
in any direction a prolonged education
and then fail to find him a position
in life which gives scope for his
ability, we are surely conferring on
him a very doubtful blessing. The
major portion of his time after his
leaving school will be spent in earning
a livelihood; and the way in which
he spends that time will have an
enormous effect on his happiness. The
frustrated and disgruntled man of
culture is socially objectionable and
politically dangerous. The dictum
that education should teach a man
how to use his leisure is one of those
half-truths whose easy acceptance is
so dangerous; in the future we shall
have to learn the complementary half-truth
that education must fit the individual
for his life’s work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>The exponents of the “liberal
education” theory are usually those
who are most urgent in pleading that
the aim of the school should be the
formation of character. They maintain
that the pupil’s personality can
be developed and modified by the
influences brought to bear on him in
the school environment. Holding
such views, they cannot ignore the
need for providing a suitable career
for the pupil after he leaves school.
The process of forming his character
does not cease as soon as he enters
business; on the contrary, the nature
of his occupation—its suitability or
unsuitability to his temperament—will
profoundly influence him for
good or for evil. The school cannot,
therefore, ignore the duty imposed on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
it of guiding its pupils as far as possible
into the vocations for which they
are naturally fitted.</p>

<p>The theoretical considerations just
mentioned are reinforced by others of
the most practical importance. For
Great Britain, and indeed for the
whole of Europe, the economic
struggle during the next few years
will be most intense. Conditions will
be such that this country, in particular,
will have to make the most of its
human as well as its material resources.
It will not be able to afford
the wastage of human ability either
through failure to find out and cultivate
the best brains or through neglect
to fit the man to the job. It will be
forced to adopt a system of training
which will provide an education at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
once liberal and adapted to economic
needs. And it will be useless for the
more narrow idealist to bewail the intrusion
of economics into the domain
of education. After all, literature, the
arts, and the study of pure science
flourish only so long as economic conditions
permit. Just as the man who
is constantly toiling for bread is debarred
from purely cultural pursuits,
so the nation whose economic position
is unsound can spare its children
neither the money nor the time for
any education beyond the most elementary.</p>

<p>Nor is there any real antagonism
between the claims of culture and
those of economics. The State which
seeks economic health must demand
that each citizen shall do his best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
work. He will do his best work in
the vocation for which he has a
natural aptitude. The business of the
school is to discover and foster natural
aptitudes. The business of the State
as an economic entity is to contrive
by all possible means to guide its
children into suitable vocations. In a
state with a proper economic organisation
there must, therefore, of necessity
be a vital connection between a child’s
school-training and his future career.</p>

<p>But this statement of the essential
relationship between aptitudes, education,
and vocation does not mean that
schools should become merely training-establishments
to act as feeders to
particular professions or industries: it
does not mean that the schoolmaster
or a government official should examine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
every pupil at the age of twelve
or fourteen and decide that he must
be an engineer or a draper’s assistant
and proceed to train him for that purpose
and draft him into a post in due
course. It does mean, however, that
the boy, for instance, who wants to
use his hands, and may eventually
become an engineer, should not be
given a bookish education which takes
little or no account of his abilities and
interests; it does mean that such a boy
should pass through a course of instruction
which will at once give scope
for his native powers and through
them develop his whole mentality; it
does mean, also, that the school and
the State should not dismiss that boy
at a given age and allow him to drift
into a clerkship merely because of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
some accidental financial considerations
or because conditions of entrance
to the engineering trade clash with
academic arrangements. In short, it
means that the school-system should
be adapted to the boy and not the
boy to the system, and, further, that
education authorities should regard it
as part of their function to guide into
proper channels the special abilities
which the teachers have reared.</p>

<p>Presented in this way, the case for
some sort of correlation between education
and vocation should convince
even those obstinate opponents of
“vocational training” who are apt to
see in such a proposal nothing but a
device of the devil (in the guise of
the Federation of British Industries)
for the more efficient production of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
“wage-slaves.” As ever increasing
numbers of boys and girls pass into
places of higher education, teachers
are realising more and more the need
for reform on the lines indicated.
They see the waste of effort involved
in passing boys and girls wholesale
through a system which takes little
account of individual differences or
even of broad differences of type.
They see that for many children a
“liberal education” is not necessarily
one which follows the traditional academic
curriculum, but rather one
which suits itself to individual needs
and which seeks to develop the pupil’s
powers by setting him to do what he
can do, instead of forcing him to try
to do what he can never do with
success.</p>

<small>THE SCHOOLS<br>

<span class="smcap">Future Developments</span></small></h2>
</div>


<p>From the considerations adduced
and the trend of opinion indicated in
the previous chapter, we are able to
give a reasonable forecast of practical
developments in the next few years.
In general terms we may say that our
educational system will be made purposive
where it is now haphazard,
and that it will be brought into
definite connection with the economic
life of the country. Education will
be regarded as a preparation for livelihood
as well as for life,—as a training<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
for working citizens rather than
for a leisured class. Further, the
waste of human effort will be avoided
as far as possible by constantly observing
the individual child and guiding
him along lines which offer him the
best chance of intellectual progress,
and which give the best opportunities
for a career in life. This, of course,
implies that the types of instruction
available will be much more numerous
and varied than they are at present.
No pupil whose schooling is provided
wholly or partly at public expense
will be allowed to proceed to courses
for which, in the opinion of the competent
authority, he is unfitted,
though no obstacles will be placed in
the way of a transfer from one course
to another if circumstances warrant it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
The individual capacity of the pupil
will be made the starting-point for
the teacher: the heresy which gives
our present system the character of a
Chicago canned-meat factory will be
abandoned. As a corollary we shall
give less exclusive reverence to purely
bookish attainments and we shall realise
that training in craftsmanship
may be as productive to one individual,
and hence to the State, as
training in the differential calculus is
to another.</p>

<p>We may assume that in the not too
remote future every child of the
required mental capacity will receive
education to the age of sixteen at
least. Of course, financial stringency
will delay progress for some years.
When the necessary school-accommodation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
is available every pupil in an
institution under public control will
be tested at a suitable age, probably
at eleven plus. The results of the
carefully devised examination will be
collated with the report of his teachers
and it will be decided whether he is
fit to be given further instruction of
a secondary character, and, if so, what
form of training will suit his special
needs. Methods of examination will
be so far improved that few serious
mistakes will be made in assessing the
capacity of pupils. In any case, this
regular test will not be regarded as
final and irrevocable; the boy or girl
who at a later age gives evidence of
the need for a revised judgment will
receive special treatment.</p>

<p>Pupils of the required standard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
will be drafted into the secondary
schools at eleven plus. Those who
remain in the primary schools until
fourteen will be of roughly two
grades; those whose ability fits them
for work of some skill in trades or
in the humbler ranks of business, and
those of very low intelligence who are
naturally destined for unskilled occupations.
The former will pass from
the elementary schools into some form
of vocational training; the latter will
go straight into industry and will receive
no further teaching other than
what may be given in some kind of
continuation class.</p>

<p>Thus the principle of excluding all
children of low mentality from secondary
education in institutions under
public control will be definitely accepted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
This step will not be taken,
of course, without much opposition.
Political irrelevancies will come into
play as soon as it is suggested. The
cry will go up that, whereas the rich
child, no matter what his capacity, will
continue to be given a public school
education, the poor child of the same
mental capacity will be deprived of
such an indulgence. Of course, the
children of the two classes will not
receive equal treatment. But so long
as the State allows the existence of
schools which it does not control, so
long as it allows parents to contract
out of the educational system, it will
not be able to prevent wealthy people
from spending their money on their
brainless children, if they choose to
do so. Clearly, however, if the State<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
provides a costly system of free, or
largely free, education, it will have
the right to exercise its power of excluding
from some or all of the benefits
of that system, children (of whatever
social position) who will not
profit by it. Moreover, by requiring
the same standard of ability from
both scholarship-holders and fee-payers
the authorities will remove the
present iniquity by which, owing to
insufficient free places, able children
of poor parents are debarred from
secondary schools while incompetent
children of parents who can afford to
pay a fraction of the cost secure admission.</p>

<p>Another objection likely to be put
forward is that geniuses who blossom
late will be lost to the world, if such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
drastic methods of exclusion are
adopted. It is urged that the
potentiality of a boy or girl cannot
always be finally determined at the
age of fourteen. This may be true;
but it is also true that in at least
ninety-nine per cent. of cases a competent
teacher who has observed a
child for some years can gauge his
capacity sufficiently accurately at that
age; and, in any case, the child has
by that time been given the tools of
learning in the ability to read and
write. Moreover, your genius frequently
does not take kindly to academic
routine, and not seldom he
looks with amused contempt at the
efforts of the mediocre pedagogue to
keep him in the recognised paths of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
learning. The biographers have been
at pains to establish the fact that
Shakespeare attended the Grammar
School at Stratford. But we cannot
doubt that “Hamlet” would have
been written even if Shakespeare had
never suffered the ferule and the
Latin grammar of the Stratford
dominie. The knowledge of people
and places which Dickens picked up
while running the streets was of more
service to him as a novelist than anything
he might have learned under
the eye of a master who should have
tried, with doubtful success, to instil
into him a proper respect for history
and a right appreciation of poetry. In
fact, it may be reasonably doubted
whether any child of latent genius, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
even talent, will be blighted for ever
through failure to receive the blessings
of the academic course.</p>

<p>To come to details of the various
types of schools in the future. With
regard to secondary education, we
may anticipate that to meet varied
needs three different courses will be
provided. A curriculum of roughly
the same type as the present will be
retained for those boys and girls of
the highest grades of intelligence;
that is to say, those who have the
ability to proceed to university studies
and who, in favourable circumstances,
intend to do so. This curriculum will,
however, be relieved of some of the
subjects which at present overcrowd
it through the attempt to provide an
“omnibus” course by grafting the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
various “modern” studies on the old
classical and mathematical courses.</p>

<p>Side by side with instruction of this
type there will be at least two other
types provided for pupils who can
profit by full-time higher training
until the age of sixteen or beyond.
One course will be of a definitely
practical character designed for the
needs of those who are fitted to occupy
leading positions in industry.
Handwork will form a prominent
feature, and a broad technical training
will be given on cultural lines.
The work will not be directly vocational
in intention, nor will book-learning
of the usual kind be entirely
neglected: the object will be to provide
a training of the greatest educational
value for students of a certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
type. The syllabus will be determined
to some extent by the nature of local
industries. In the big towns it will
be a fairly simple matter to relate the
technical teaching to the dominant
manufacturing processes carried on in
the area. In country districts it will
be the business of these courses to
foster that interest in rural industries
which is at present so disastrously
lacking. Already a certain number
of secondary schools in the country
are making a definite attempt to organise
their teaching on lines intended
to be of the greatest value to those
pupils who intend to take up occupations
connected with agriculture or
horticulture. The fact that more has
not been done in this direction is explained
in a significant sentence in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
pamphlet issued by the Board of
Education on the subject.—“Hitherto
the majority of parents have unfortunately
been inclined to regard
entry into commerce or into some
clerical occupation as the only fitting
sequel to a secondary school training,
and there has been, therefore, little or
no demand on their part that the
education given to their children in
the secondary school should be related
to rural life and needs.” As a preliminary
to the successful establishment
of secondary schools with a technical
bias it will thus be necessary to
convince parents that suitable careers
exist for their children in industry.
Such schools must be recognised as
the normal stepping-stones to the
higher industrial positions, either<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
directly or by way of the Technical
or Agricultural College of university
rank.</p>

<p>A third course will be designed for
pupils who are likely to benefit from
continued education after fourteen,
but who are not suited to the purely
academic studies and have no marked
practical bent: they are probably
destined for the fairly skilled commercial
posts. The work in this course
will be largely of a concrete character
and will be definitely connected with
economic life; but again it will not
be directly vocational. The syllabus
will consist in the main of what are
known as the “ordinary school subjects”;
but the pupils will concentrate
on fewer subjects than is customary
at present, and emphasis will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
be laid on those aspects which are
most within the grasp of boys and
girls who lack any great interest in
ideas as such.</p>

<p>Pupils will be drafted into one or
other of the various courses not
primarily because they intend to enter
this or that profession or business
(though this might be given due consideration
at the wish of the parent),
but because their previous school-history
will have shown that their
all-round development can be best
assured in one of these courses rather
than in the others.</p>

<p>Will pupils following the various
curricula remain side by side in the
same school, or will they be separated
into different institutions? It is possible
that in London and the larger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
towns separate technical and commercial
schools of secondary grade
will be created to work side by side
with the secondary schools of the
present type. The anomalous Central
Schools of to-day can scarcely remain
a permanent feature of our
system: they might well be converted
into schools of fully secondary character
with either a commercial or a
technical bias. In the smaller areas
which can support only a single institution
for higher training the varied
courses will be pursued in the same
building. Such an arrangement will,
no doubt, present difficulties in organisation,
but it will have a considerable
advantage in the fact that free
transfer of pupils from one course
to another will be possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>What of the pupils who are judged
unfit for education of a secondary
type? Those who are likely to profit
by some sort of further teaching will
not be dismissed at the age of fourteen
to the workshop or the office;
but it will be recognised that their
interests can be best served by giving
them training of a frankly vocational
character. To meet the needs of
those who propose to enter trades
there will be organised large numbers
of trade schools in conjunction
with local industries. Here, for two
years or more, students will be prepared
for a definite occupation, and
will remain under cultural and disciplinary
influences. Junior Technical
Schools of this nature have already
been firmly established during the last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
thirty years, and in London trade-classes
exist for silversmithing, book-production,
furnishing, dressmaking,
tailoring, engineering, and so on. At
present, however, half the total number
of Junior Technical School places
provided by the county boroughs
throughout the country are in London:
we may look forward to a wide
extension of technical school facilities
in the other industrial areas during
the next few years.</p>

<p>The effective organisation of trade-schools
will entail a solution of the
problem of apprenticeship. The
apprenticeship-system has long been
obsolete: it is condemned educationally
because it involves the transference
of the pupil from the school
to the workshop at too early an age,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
and it is ineffective industrially because
under modern factory-conditions
there is no certainty that the
apprentice will even receive proper
technical training. The system is already
dead in many trades, and in
others it is kept alive only to enable
the trade unions to limit the number
of entrants into the industry. It cannot
be long, however, before common
needs force education and industry
into some sort of concordat. The industrial
firms need skilled workers;
the educationists want those skilled
workers to be trained in such a way
that they may derive educational
benefit from their technical pursuits.
To meet the difficulty there are two
obvious possibilities. The whole apprentice-system
might be abolished,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and the training of skilled workers
might be carried out entirely in technical
schools organised on the lines
of the <i lang="fr">écoles professionelles</i> of
France, which resemble factories in
their equipment and which turn out
fully-trained workers after a three
years’ course. If, on the other hand,
the rule of apprenticeship is retained,
it should be possible to substitute education
in Junior Technical Schools for
the first two years of apprenticeship.
Steps of this kind have already been
taken in London, where it is usual
for young workers to have their apprenticeship
shortened by a period
corresponding to their training in a
trade school. But, of course, further
advances in this direction can be taken
only with the co-operation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
trade unions concerned. This may
cause difficulty. Somewhat strangely,
the educational spokesmen of the
trade unions seem so much concerned
about securing a university education
for the sons of the “workers” that
they have little interest in the matter
of craft-instruction. But perhaps this
attitude of the trade union leaders is
no more strange than that of the
employers who talk loudly of the need
for increased efficiency if British
manufacturers are to compete in the
markets of the world, and yet do little
or nothing to ensure that their young
workers shall be given adequate training
for the work they are to perform.</p>

<p>But we have still to consider the
future of boys and girls of low mentality
who, on leaving the primary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
school, will normally enter unskilled
or semi-skilled occupations, and who
are not likely to profit by full-time
vocational training. It is these who
present the most difficult problem to
the educationist. It is hard to find
the right way of approach to such
children even under school-conditions;
it is far harder to exert effective
teaching-influence over them when
they have been freed from disciplinary
restraints. Yet it is imperative
for the health of the community that
young workers of this type should
not be allowed to pass entirely out of
educational control as soon as they
leave the elementary school. For
them, it would seem, the aid of Mr.
Fisher’s Act will once more have to
be invoked, and compulsory Continuation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Schools will be established. At
these classes the object will be not so
much to teach the students any specific
subjects as to keep them under disciplinary
influences and to develop in
them the sense of personal and civic
responsibility. The short experience
gained from the few continuation
schools established immediately after
1918 made it clear that giving much
purely cultural teaching to workers of
low type in unskilled jobs, however
desirable, is actually impracticable.
Nor is it generally possible to give
much direct vocational instruction.
Physical training and handwork must
be made important parts of the
courses, and good work can be done
through the formation of students’
clubs. In fact, those who have charge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
of Continuation classes will have to
regard themselves less as teachers
than as welfare-workers.</p>

<p>The scheme of development which
has been mapped out clearly demands
the creation of a link between education
and industry such as does not
at present exist. Boys and girls who,
through lack of initiative or of any
special predilection, have not found
for themselves suitable employment
by the time they are due to leave
school will not be allowed to drift
into the first blind-alley occupation
that presents itself. The education
authorities will have made full surveys
of local industrial and business
requirements and will thus be able
to indicate suitable openings. Moreover,
account will be taken of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
applicant’s special abilities in recommending
any particular post to him.
The question of vocational guidance
has for some years attracted a good
deal of attention in America, and a
considerable amount of work has been
done in this direction. In this country,
many local educational authorities
(in particular, the London boroughs)
are attempting to carry out schemes of
juvenile vocational guidance through
the After-Care Committees and the
Juvenile Advisory Committee of the
Employment Bureaux. In London,
too, the Headmasters of the Secondary
Schools have formed an Employment
Committee which puts pupils
in touch with firms who have vacancies.</p>

<p>More important in this connection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
is the investigation recently carried
out by the Industrial Fatigue Research
Board in conjunction with the National
Institute of Industrial Psychology.
Under the direction of Dr
Cyril Burt a careful study was made
of all the children (to the number
of a hundred) due to leave three
selected London schools within a
period of twelve months. All data
obtainable from the schools were collected,
the children were subjected to
mental tests, the homes were visited,
and each child was personally interviewed.
In the light of the evidence
thus obtained specific vocational recommendations
were made. After an
interval of two years the investigators
again interviewed the children in their
homes in order to test the results of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
the recommendations. It appeared
that the children who had entered
the industries suggested to them had
proved more efficient than their fellows,
and over 80 per cent. of them
declared that they were satisfied with
their position and prospects. On the
other hand, of those who obtained
employment different from the kind
recommended, less than 40 per cent.
were satisfied. The value of this experiment
is, of course, limited by the
smallness of its scale, but the results
are certainly encouraging. One point
that has been made clear is the need
for full information as to the requirements
of the various trades.</p>

<p>Such efforts at linking the schools
with the office and the workshop are
at present tentative and sporadic; but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
they are significant of future developments,—developments
which will be
hastened by the growing determination
during these years of trade depression
to prevent the waste and
deterioration of our youths, so far as
it can be prevented by better organisation.
There can be little doubt that
within the next few years we shall
be forced, if not by practical wisdom,
at least by economic necessity, into
creating a universal scheme which
shall relieve the employers of the
need for haphazard advertisement in
recruiting their junior staffs, and
which shall ensure that everything
possible is done to facilitate the entry
of a youth into that particular job in
which he can do work of most value
to himself and to the community.</p>

<p>It will be observed that our survey
of probable future developments in
the lower branches of education is
hopeful. These are good reasons for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
optimism: the trend of opinion which
will mould the schools of the future
is already clearly in evidence; our
obvious defects to-day are defects of
organisation, and these can be remedied
by any capable administrator;
the seeds of the growths we have
foreseen have already been planted;
and, finally, economic exigencies will
provide the drive necessary to overcome
the dilatoriness inseparable from
public activity. But we must confess
that we are much concerned about the
universities. There are tendencies in
university life to-day that give ample
cause for misgiving,—the more so
because they spring rather from vital
weakness reflecting the intellectual
vices of our age than from defective
methods and organisation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Not that our universities do not
show very obvious defects in method
and organisation. (We are considering
now especially the new universities.
Just as in our survey of secondary
education we made no reference
to the public schools, which have their
own tradition, and which will remain
outside a state-system, so we may now
leave out of account Oxford and
Cambridge, which have their own
teaching-methods and which again
are not likely to be amenable to state-interference.
Moreover, the inevitable
extension of higher education
will be seen in the creation of more
universities of the new type, as well
as in the enlargement of those already
in existence, and thus Oxford and
Cambridge are likely to turn out an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
ever-diminishing proportion of the
total number of graduates in this
country). Criticism may well be levelled
at the insufficient importance attached
to social life in the modern
universities. It is much too easy for
young men and women to attend
courses of lectures for three years or
so and amass a certain quantity of
information on given subjects without
coming in contact with any intellectual
influences outside the class room.
This danger is, of course, inevitable
when the students are not resident in
a college. A remedy is being provided
to some extent by the erection
of hostels, and much more may be
done in this direction; but there is
still a difficulty arising from the fairly
large proportion of students who live<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
at home in the university-town. As
part of the same problem must be
mentioned the insufficient attention
given to games. This is due not
merely to the frequent absence of
adequate playing-fields, which might
be remedied, but to the fact that
college lectures take place during the
whole of the day and are so arranged
that no considerable body of students
is free for the whole of more than
one afternoon a week. In other
words, college work is organised
solely with a view to academic requirements.</p>

<p>And then there is the teaching by
means of lectures. As a method this
was rendered obsolete as soon as books
were rapidly and cheaply printed, and
yet, whereas Oxford and Cambridge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
have long pursued a more excellent
way, the new universities have
strangely revived and perpetuated the
mediaeval practice. A century-and-a-half
ago Dr Johnson was emphatic
about the futility of lectures.
(“People have nowadays got a strange
opinion that everything should be
taught by lectures. Now, I cannot
see that lectures can do so much good
as reading the books from which the
lectures are taken. I know nothing
that can be best taught by lectures,
except where experiments are to be
shewn. You may teach chymistry by
lectures. You might teach making of
shoes by lectures!”). It is delightful
to imagine his remarks if he could
walk through a modern college and
see dozens of lecturers each droning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
from his rostrum,—in these days
when library shelves and publishers’
store-rooms are stuffed with reliable
text-books on every conceivable subject.
Surely no system of teaching
can have ever been devised with so
little regard for ordinary efficiency.
Batches of students are set to take imperfect
notes of a probably imperfectly
delivered lecture by a man who
has either taken his material from
books that they ought to read themselves,
or is dictating what is really
an original text-book, which obviously,
in the interests of economy in time
and labour, to say nothing of accuracy,
ought to be printed. It is to be feared
that under present arrangements a
college lecturer fulfils the whole of
the duties officially required of him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
if he thus turns himself into a gramophone
for so many hours per week.
If university-teaching meant no more
than this, and if the lecture were its
only channel, we should feel bound
to urge that the present wasteful
duplication of lectures in various university-centres
should be avoided by
enlisting the aid of wireless, and that
standard lectures should be broadcast
to students throughout the kingdom
in their own homes.</p>

<p>The educational efficacy of the universities
of this and other countries
is being weakened, however, by a
more insidious disease,—a disease of
which the defective teaching-methods
and the excessive absorption in purely
academic pursuits are merely outward
symptoms. The intellectual and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
moral malady of this present age has
infected our seats of learning so that
they appear to be abandoning the
ideal of a liberal education and to be
substituting the narrow aim of the
acquisition of specialised knowledge.
The modern university must be a
centre of research: the danger is that
it will neglect to be also a centre of
education.</p>

<p>Research is the intellectual idol of
our time. The fiery zeal for discovery
which animates us resembles
that which was abroad five centuries
ago in Europe. Indeed, we of to-day
are borne along by the second
wave of the great tide of the Renaissance.
The great awakening of the
human spirit, due, in part, to the rediscovery
of ancient literature and art,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
urged men to the passionate pursuit
of truth and beauty. Research and
creative activity went hand in hand.
The inspiration which produced the
great scholars, painters, and architects
lasted for a season. Then the vital
energy was dissipated: scholarship degenerated
into gerund-grinding, literature
into stylistic display, and art
into lifeless imitation. But meanwhile
the newly-liberated spirit of enquiry
was turning from the past and seeking
fresh objects of study in natural
phenomena. Slowly and tentatively,
at first, the human intellect explored
the fringes of those vast fields of
knowledge which had lain almost untouched
since the time of the Greeks.
Then, in the last century, the scattered
sparks suddenly flamed into a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
great outburst of scientific discovery,
and the western mind was amazed by
the undreamed-of treasures spread
before it. Here was a second Renaissance,
the child of the first and informed
with the same spirit of divine
curiosity, but working in a new direction.
The prime object of the nineteenth
century investigator was to
accumulate observed facts about the
material universe, to find theories to
interpret those facts, and perhaps ultimately
to lay bare the innermost
secrets of Nature. More and more
wonders were discovered; and each
new wonder pointed the road to fresh
territories awaiting the pioneer. There
must be formed a great army of explorers.
The recruitment and the
training of this army was naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
carried on in the universities. The
aims and methods of science acquired
enormous prestige. The spirit of research
pervaded every department of
academic activity.</p>

<p>In the reorganised universities of
nineteenth-century Germany, the new
spirit found its most complete expression.
The professor was given a
two-fold function: he was to teach,
and also to advance his particular
study or science. To-day teaching is
often made subordinate to research.
A characteristic product of the German
academic system is the “seminar,”
which is for the student of
humanistic learning what the laboratory
is to the scientist: in the seminar
the student is given training in
methods of original investigation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
The course of study is highly specialised
and leads to the degree of “doctor
of philosophy,” for which he must
present a dissertation contributing to
the advance of knowledge. The close
association of American students with
Germany has led to the importation
of German university methods and
ideals into the United States. In
England, too, there has been an ever-increasing
tendency to approximate
our standards to those of Germany.
The Honours courses, at any rate at
the new universities, become increasingly
specialised, and more and more
insistence is being laid on the necessity
for original research as the crown
of an academic career.</p>

<p>Thus the universities are living in
an intellectual atmosphere manufactured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
by the scientists. The great
craving is for knowledge,—knowledge
of natural processes, and knowledge
of man’s past history. This
craving manifests itself at every
turn. Apart from the labours of
scientists, historians, and archaeologists
in what Johnson calls the “academic
bowers,” we read daily of
search-parties (many of whom are
organised by European or American
universities) proceeding to the ends
of the earth,—this one bringing to
light the treasures of Egyptian royal
tombs, another revealing a hitherto
unknown civilisation of the ancient
world, a third finding dinosaur’s eggs,
a fourth studying the characteristics
and the history of a savage tribe. A
leading newspaper recently informed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
us proudly that no fewer than two
hundred exploring parties are setting
out this year on various quests—more
than ever before in the history of the
world. The interest in these efforts
is not confined to the few. Accounts
of marvellous discoveries and inventions
bring romance to the millions
in our industrial civilisation. The
popular press knows the appeal of big
headlines over an article giving a
highly coloured account of the latest
results of research; and the bookstalls
are crowded with magazines devoted
to the Wonders of Science and giving
the City clerk and typist, hungry for
knowledge, an Illustrated Outline of
this, that, or the other field of information.</p>

<p>Whither is this enthusiasm for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
knowledge leading us? What benefits
will accrue to the individual or to
society when, with untold labour, we
have learned a fraction more about the
history of man or penetrated a few
steps further into the illimitable
arcana of nature? These are questions
which those engaged in investigation
and those whose delight is to
hear some new thing alike hardly
pause to ask. It is assumed that all
knowledge of fact is valuable, and
therefore is to be pursued for its own
sake. To many this will seem a self-evident
proposition. Such people may
be reminded that curiosity about the
material world has not always been a
characteristic of the western nations.
For many centuries man was not in
the least interested to know whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
the earth went round the sun or the
sun round the earth: he was content
to take on trust the evidence of his
senses. It is even a matter for debate
whether the sum of human happiness
has been increased by the
knowledge that has come from
Galileo’s labours. It is a perennial
human weakness to pursue one aim to
the unreasonable exclusion of others,
to mistake the means for the end.
The great humanists were so possessed
by ideals which they found in
the antique world that they sought to
achieve them even at the expense of
personal and social morality; their
successors mistook the husk for the
kernel and allowed pedantry to displace
scholarship. We of this age are
being diverted from other aims and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
allowing our intellectual life to be
narrowed by an unreasoning zeal for
research. We are influenced too much
by the delusion that the making of
“a contribution to knowledge” is the
beginning of wisdom.</p>

<p>Will the universities rid themselves
of the incubus of research, or at least
relegate it to a separate department
so that the main efforts of the professors
and lecturers may be concentrated
on other matters? On the
answer to this question the future of
the universities depends. It must be
decided whether the primary business
of the university teacher is to teach
or to carry on the investigations in
which he is privately interested;
whether the business of the student<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
is to become educated or to become a
specialist; whether, in short, there is
any necessary relationship between the
two branches of university activity,—research
and education. At present
there is little indication of how these
problems will be settled: as yet they
are scarcely mentioned in academic
circles in this country. Criticism of
university methods and ideals is heard
among people who have left professorial
tutelage, and book-reviewers
are occasionally entertaining at the
expense of typical products of the
academic mind; but for the most part
the standards of the dons are taken
for granted. The late Sir Walter
Raleigh, it is true, did not conceal
his antipathy to the “serious business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
of scholarship,” but his brother professors
must have considered him a
sad dog.</p>

<p>While English universities give no
sign of interest in fundamental problems
affecting their well-being, a ray
of hope comes from America. In the
recent annual report of Columbia
University, the president, Dr Nicholas
Murray Butler, speaking with all
the authority of his distinguished
position, faces critical issues with a
frankness that is possible, perhaps,
only in America. He is concerned
about the dearth of great minds in
spite of the spread of educational
facilities, and he asks whether the
universities have not destroyed the
ideal of a liberal education, and with
it the liberally educated man himself,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
through allowing the choice of less
valuable subjects and laying too much
stress on early specialisation. In spite
of the efforts of two generations to
make science an instrument of education,
and in spite of the inherent excellence
of the scientific method, he
has grave doubts about the results.
He finds the cause of his dissatisfaction
in the methods and aims of the
teachers of the sciences. “If these
subjects are to be presented only for
the purpose of training specialists,
and if the methods to be followed are
those that, while appropriate for investigation,
have no relation whatever
to interpretation, then it may
well be that in another generation
general interest in the natural and experimental
sciences and general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
knowledge of their meaning and
significance will have greatly declined....
The example of the
ancient classics ought to suffice. They
were killed largely by those who
taught them.” On the subject of research
Dr Butler is equally outspoken.
“The word research,” he
says, “has come to be something like
the blessed word Mesopotamia. It is
used to reduce everyone to silence,
acquiescence, and approbation. The
fact of the matter is that something
between seventy-five per cent. and
ninety per cent. of what is called research
in the various universities and
institutes of the land is not properly
research at all, but simply the re-arrangement
or re-classification of
existing data or well-known phenomena.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
He reminds his readers
that “an original investigation may,
and usually does, add a good deal
to the knowledge of the individual
investigator without adding anything
to the knowledge of the human
race.”</p>

<p>Dr Butler attacks the principles on
which present-day science-teaching in
the universities is carried out: such an
indictment applies with equal, if not
with greater force, to the teaching of
the humanities, into which scientific
methods have intruded themselves
with disastrous results. It is natural
that the historian of to-day should
adopt the character of the scientific
investigator; but surely something is
wrong when university and other
presses issue volume after volume of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
historical study of a kind which,
judged by any of the wider canons,
can have no conceivable value. Too
often the specialists forget that the
many intriguing little puzzles that
they try to solve are intriguing little
puzzles and nothing more. The researcher
in the natural sciences can
always plead that his discoveries, however
insignificant at the moment, may
take on great importance in connection
with work in other fields. The
researcher in history can hardly put
forward the same plea. The scientific
or pseudo-scientific spirit applied
to history has tended to destroy the
sense of values.</p>

<p>Literature at the universities is in
even a worse plight. The scientific
historical method applied in this field<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
is steadily devitalising literary study.
Criticism and enjoyment of the great
masters have to give place to the
study of tendencies and influences, of
historical minutiae and bibliographical
irrelevancies. The academic mind
apparently fails to see any incongruity
in the eagerness and seriousness with
which learned societies recently discussed
the precise circumstances of the
death of Marlowe; nor is it shocked
at the regularity with which university
lecturers and others write letters
to the “Times Literary Supplement,”
taking leave to record some “new
fact” about a relative of a tenth-rate
poet whose name lives only in the
bigger histories of literature. Immature
graduates in the American schools
of English are steadily working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
through all our writers who are sufficiently
unimportant to have escaped
attention hitherto and producing monographs
on them “in part preparation
for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
in the University of ——.”
And as money is plentiful in the
American universities the theses are
duly printed. Similar so-called literary
research is being carried on with
unremitting energy in this country
also; happily the results of most of
it remain decently buried in the university
archives. Dr Butler foresees
a probable decline in the educational
importance of scientific study through
concentration on the unessentials and
neglect of the essentials: for the same
reason it is to be feared that the university
departments of modern literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
are already well on the road to
decadence.</p>

<p>The outlook for university education
is therefore not hopeful. It
seems probable that the worship of
the false gods of the academic world
will take an unconscionable time in
dying. Universities are conservative
places: they hold themselves superior,
and often rightly superior, to the
rough and tumble of the world outside,
and thus they are tardy in responding
to the changing spirit of
the age. Moreover, by their very
system they are cramping the free intelligence
and narrowing the vision of
those who are to direct the universities
of the future. Success in university
life necessarily involves obedience
to the tradition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>Thus it may be assumed that present
tendencies will take a generation
or two to reach their limit. With the
improvement in the secondary schools
through the better selection of pupils
the standard of work there will be
forced up to such a pitch that every
student proceeding to the university
will immediately specialise in a narrow
field. Pass degrees will be abolished.
The prestige of research-degrees
will be such that most, if not
all, graduates will proceed to them.
In every university there will be a
busy colony of researchers. In the
departments of science in its various
branches men and women will be
labouring to discover new phenomena
and to formulate fresh theories.
Much of this work will fulfil the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
laudable purpose of improving man’s
material lot. Much of it, on the
other hand, will have the practical
result of supplying an industrialised
community with a surfeit of mechanical
luxuries which the ordinary person
will have neither the desire nor
the time to use. The spirit of man
may find some consolation in increased
knowledge of such matters as the
habits of atoms exposed to various
sorts of experimental bombardments.
In the departments of the modern
languages and literatures the soil will
have been so far exhausted that students
will be reduced to collating and
editing (with linguistic commentary)
the dullest and most obscure mediaeval
manuscripts. Or the American
example will be followed of writing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
dissertations on recent or contemporary
writers. We may expect doctoral
theses with such titles as—“A
Bibliographical Account of the Works
of Arnold Bennett, together with a
Hand-list of his Contributions to the
Periodical Press”; or “The Sussex
Farm-Labourer in English Fiction
from 1900 to 1930.” In the realm
of history, the evidence of the past
will, in most directions, have been
sifted and re-sifted; accounts of first-rate,
second-rate, and even third-rate
men and movements will have been
multiplied <i lang="la">ad nauseam</i> on the excuse
that an additional insignificant fact or
two has been added to information
that was already accessible. Students
will be driven to editing the dreariest
records (if any still remain unpublished)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
elucidating matters of the
least possible concern to the twentieth
century. They will, no doubt, be sustained
in their thankless tasks by the
thought that they are doing the
Spade-work: they are doing their
share, however humble, towards providing
a greater than themselves with
the materials for a new survey of a
period. We can only hope that their
single-minded devotion may not be
disturbed by the horrible thought that
the mass of accumulated research on
any given topic will eventually be so
vast that no single human life will
give sufficient time in which to read it,
and that no single human mind will
be equal to the task of synthesising it.</p>

<p>When the cult of research has thus
reduced itself to absurdity the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
will come when we shall perhaps turn
to the conception of a university as a
place where, by the study and discussion
of problems of fundamental importance,
the most intelligent young
men and women are brought into contact
with the best and most stimulating
minds, where the balance is held
true between intellect and emotion,
between thought and action.</p>

<p>But that time is not yet.</p>
